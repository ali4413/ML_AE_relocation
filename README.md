# ML_AE_relocation
File description:
1. AE_train.mat - Locations (x,z) of pencil break events in the training data and their relative P-wave arrival pickings.
2. AErelocNet_2D_Deploy.mat - ANNs trained to output AE source location on the laboratory fault (x,z).
3. AE_test_arrivals.mat - P-wave arrival pickings of 96 AE events recorded during the slip test.
4. sample_after_slip.jpg - Raw image of the laboratory fault after the slip test.
5. fault_surf_impose.jpg - Relocated AE locations plotted  on top of the image of the laboratory fault after slip test.
